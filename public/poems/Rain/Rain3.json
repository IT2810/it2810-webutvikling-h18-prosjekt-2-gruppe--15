    "title": "Rain",
    "verses": ["Toward evening, as the light failed </br> and the pear tree at my window darkened, </br> I put down my book and stood at the open door, </br> the first raindrops gusting in the eaves, </br> a smell of wet clay in the wind. </br> Sixty years ago, lying beside my father, </br> half asleep, on a bed of pine boughs as rain </br> drummed against our tent, I heard </br> for the first time a loon’s sudden wail </br> drifting across that remote lake— </br> a loneliness like no other, </br> though what I heard as inconsolable </br> may have been only the sound of something </br> untamed and nameless </br> singing itself to the wilderness around it </br> and to us until we slept. And thinking of my father </br> and of good companions gone </br> into oblivion, I heard the steady sound of rain </br> and the soft lapping of water, and did not know </br> whether it was grief or joy or something other </br> that surged against my heart </br> and held me listening there so long and late."],
