    "title": "Rain",
    "verses": ["Rain, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain </br> On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me </br> Remembering again that I shall die</br> And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks </br> For washing me cleaner than I have been </br> Since I was born into solitude. </br> Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon: </br> But here I pray that none whom once I loved </br> Is dying tonight or lying still awake </br> Solitary, listening to the rain, </br> Either in pain or thus in sympathy </br> Helpless among the living and the dead, </br> Like a cold water among broken reeds, </br> Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff, </br> Like me who have no love which this wild rain </br> Has not dissolved except the love of death,</br> If love it be towards what is perfect and </br> Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint."],
