    "verses": ["When with the skin you do acknowledge drought, </br> The dry in the voice, the lightness of feet, the fine </br> Flake of the heat at every level line; </br> When with the hand you learn to touch without </br> Surprise the spine for the leaf, the prickled petal, </br> The stone scorched in the shine, and the wood brittle; </br> </br> Then where the pipe drips and the fronds sprout </br> And the foot-square forest of clover blooms in sand, </br> You will lean and watch, but never touch with your hand."],
