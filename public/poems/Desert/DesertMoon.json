    "verses": ["Forwhom does this moon rise? </br> Who stands to share the nighted skies, </br> as evening falls and morning dies? </br> Whose eyes will search the velvet night </br> to find each drop of golden light? </br> Which heart will sing enchanted tunes </br> whose words are wrought of mystic runes </br> and woven into Desert Moons?","For whom does this moon shine? </br> Who stands beneath that ancient sine </br> and boldly claim this time is mine? </br> Whose hand will touch the velvet night </br> and tease the ripples of moonlight? </br> Whose fingers trace the muted runes </br> pressed deep into the silent dunes </br> reach out and find the Desert Moons?"],
