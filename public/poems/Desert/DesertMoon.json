    "verses": ["Forwhom does this moon rise? "," Who stands to share the nighted skies, "," as evening falls and morning dies? "," Whose eyes will search the velvet night "," to find each drop of golden light? "," Which heart will sing enchanted tunes "," whose words are wrought of mystic runes "," and woven into Desert Moons?","For whom does this moon shine? "," Who stands beneath that ancient sine "," and boldly claim this time is mine? "," Whose hand will touch the velvet night "," and tease the ripples of moonlight? "," Whose fingers trace the muted runes "," pressed deep into the silent dunes "," reach out and find the Desert Moons?"],
