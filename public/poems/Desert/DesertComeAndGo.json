    "verses": ["Is it a desert, only time will tell, "," a landscape between heaven and hell. "," Every ten thousand years or so, "," the ice will come, the ice then will go.", "In one place the ocean throws water across the land, "," another place flowers beyond numbers to count grow. "," In time, only a desert will tell, "," the span between heaven and hell."],
